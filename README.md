# Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps and Linux Setup

## 📘 Overview

On the first day of the DevOps learning program, we were introduced to the challenges faced during the development and operations phases of building software applications. We discussed the gap between development and operations teams and understood the need for DevOps practices to improve collaboration and efficiency.

We were also given an overview of the 6-day DevOps course structure.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Challenges in traditional Software Development and Operations
- Introduction to DevOps
- Course roadmap explanation
- Basics of Linux (Ubuntu) commands

## 💻 Practical Implementation

After the theory session:

- Installed VMware Workstation Pro
- Created a new Virtual Machine
- Booted Ubuntu OS inside VMware
- Accessed and worked using the Ubuntu Terminal (CLI mode)

We primarily used the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** instead of the graphical desktop environment.

## 🐧 Linux Commands Practiced

The following basic Linux commands were executed in the Ubuntu terminal:

- `pwd` – Displays current working directory  
- `ls` – Lists files and directories  
- `whoami` – Shows the current logged-in user  
- `uname -a` – Displays system and kernel information  

These commands helped in understanding basic Linux navigation and system details.
