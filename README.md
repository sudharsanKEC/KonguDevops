Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps and Linux Setup
      On the very first day, we were introduced to the challenges faced during the development and operations phases of building software applications. After discussing these difficulties, we learned about the need to overcome them and were introduced to DevOps concepts.
      We were also briefed on the structure of the 6-day DevOps course.
      After completing the theory session, we were taught basic Linux (Ubuntu) commands. Later, we installed VMware Workstation Pro and booted Ubuntu inside a virtual machine.
      This setup allowed us to practice Linux commands in a virtualized environment without affecting the host operating system.
