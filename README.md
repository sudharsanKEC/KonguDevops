# Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps and Linux Setup

## 📘 Overview

On the first day of the DevOps learning program, we were introduced to the challenges faced during the **development** and **operations** phases of building software applications. We discussed why these gaps exist and how DevOps helps bridge them by improving collaboration, automation, and deployment speed.

We were also briefed on the overall structure of the 6-day DevOps course.
